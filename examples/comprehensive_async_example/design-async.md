Add comprehensive async nodes and async flows support to the tracing system. This enhancement should include:

1. **Async Node Support**: Extend the current node tracing capabilities to handle asynchronous operations, including:
   - Tracing async function calls and their execution context
   - Capturing async node lifecycle events (start, suspend, resume, complete)
   - Maintaining proper parent-child relationships for async operations
   - Handling concurrent async node execution

2. **Async Flow Support**: Implement flow-level async tracing that can:
   - Track async flow execution across multiple async nodes
   - Maintain flow state during async operations
   - Handle flow branching and merging in async contexts
   - Preserve execution order and timing information

3. **Reference Implementation**: Use the node definitions and patterns found in `pocketflow-tracing\docs\pocketflow.py` as the reference for:
   - Understanding the current node structure and interface
   - Ensuring compatibility with existing synchronous node implementations
   - Following established patterns for node lifecycle management

4. **Requirements**:
   - Maintain backward compatibility with existing synchronous tracing
   - Ensure thread-safety for concurrent async operations
   - Provide clear async/await integration points
   - Include proper error handling for async operations
   - Add appropriate logging and debugging support for async traces

Please analyze the existing codebase structure, examine the reference file for node definitions, and implement a comprehensive async tracing solution that integrates seamlessly with the current system.
